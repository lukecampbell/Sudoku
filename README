Compiling:
  $ make

Compile with reference counting enabled:
  $ make CPPFLAGS='-g -ggdb -Wall -O0 -D_MEMCHECK_'

Reference Counting Explained:
  If you enable reference counting, every non-exception object is referenced
  and the sum of their references and dereferences is displayed before 
  application exit.

Debugging is disabled by default

You should not receive any errors during make

Running: 
  $ ./Sudoku

Running the unit tests:
