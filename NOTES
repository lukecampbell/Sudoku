Square::~Square()
  Tedious trace output
In Square.cpp:53 I commented out the destructor's print capabilities for trace purposes.  When this was left uncommented it caused extreme amounts of tedious parsing to reveal pertinent information.  I am going to leave this for the debugging aspect only.  To visually see tracing and the destructor calls I recommend compiling with the __DEBUG__ macro defined.  See README for instructions.
